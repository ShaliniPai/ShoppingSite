The rattan frame – steamed and bent into shape by hand – is accented with hand-wrapped rattan peel around the joints giving a antique look to it."

It can define different areas in your home (a boon for open floor plans), create an intimate corner, and add a striking design element to the room. Here, three caned panels are edged in hand-wrapped in rattan to achieve gorgeous texture and tone. Brass end caps on the feet add an elevating finishing touch."

Next, we added a roomy storage drawer and a pull-out shelf that can serve as a mini bar when guests arrive. Your very own curation would make this all the more special – your favorite books, your favorite mementos."
